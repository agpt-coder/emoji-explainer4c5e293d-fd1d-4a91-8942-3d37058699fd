    """
    This POST endpoint receives an emoji as input from the user, sends a request to the GROQ platform to retrieve the explanation and meaning of the provided emoji. The endpoint integrates with the GROQ API, crafting a query based on the received emoji and parsing the GROQ response to format a user-friendly explanation. Expected responses include a success case with the emoji's meaning or a fail case with an error message (e.g., unsupported emoji). This route is essential to allow real-time emoji explanations to users across various devices, owing to the Responsive Design Module's capability to adapt the response format according to the device.

    Args:
        emoji_character (str): The emoji character for which the meaning is requested.

    Returns:
        EmojiExplainResponse: This response contains either the explanation of the emoji or an error message in case the emoji is not supported.

    Example:
        response = explainEmoji('ðŸ˜€')
        response.meaning
        > 'A yellow face with simple, open eyes and a broad, open smile.'
